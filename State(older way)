A React component can access dynamic information in two ways: props and state.
Unlike props, a component’s state is not passed in from the outside. A component decides its own state.
To make a component have state, give the component a state property. This property should be declared inside of a constructor method
syntax
class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { mood: 'decent' };
  }
 
  render() {
    return <div></div>;
  }
}
 
<Example />

Update state with this.setState
A component changes its state by calling the function this.setState().

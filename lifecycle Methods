The component lifecycle has three high-level parts:
*)Mounting, when the component is being initialized and put into the DOM for the first time
*)Updating, when the component updates as a result of changed state or changed props
*)Unmounting, when the component is being removed from the DOM

Mounting, when the component is being initialized and put into the DOM for the first time.
We saw that the constructor, render(), and componentDidMount() are called during this phase.

Unmounting, when the component is being removed from the DOM. We saw that componentWillUnmount() was called here,
which was a good time to clean things up.
